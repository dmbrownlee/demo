# LAB 00-1

## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will be installing the virtual lab environment for the study
group.  Most of the labs in this course will give you vague steps to follow
with the assumption you have learned the material and can complete the steps
without specific guidence.  However, this lab is just to get your virtual
environment installed so you have a platform on which to get hands-on practice
and this is not something you are expected to know how to do for the Network+
exam.  Therefore, the steps here will be a bit more detailed.

## SETUP

The instructions for setting up the lab environment assume, and were tested on,
a fresh install of the host operating system (MacOS X or Debian Linux).  If you
encounter problems, it may be because something in your environment has deviated
from what is present in a clean, default installation of the OS.  If possible,
it is recommended you start with a newly installed machine.

## STEPS

### Overview

Here is an overview of the process:
  1. Ensure your OS meets the prerequisites
  2. Run the setup script for the demo project
  3. Run the setup script in the course directory for your study group

The above steps will take a significant amount of time and require a reliable
Internet connection.  However, there is very little for you to do in the way
of manual steps, it is mostly waiting for the setup scripts to finish.

You must do the three steps in order.  If one step fails, you need to fis it
first before continuing with later steps.  The first two steps are detailed in
the demo project's [README.md](https://github.com/dmbrownlee/demo/blob/release/README.md).

After you have completed the setup for the demo project, proceed by following
the course setup instructions in the Network+ [README.md](https://github.com/dmbrownlee/demo/blob/release/networkplus/README.md) file.
