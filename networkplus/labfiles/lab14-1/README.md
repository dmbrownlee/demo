## Exam Objective ðŸ“‘
[5.0 Network Troubleshooting and Tools: 5.4 Given a scenario, troubleshoot common wireless
connectivity and performance issues.](https://www.comptia.jp/pdf/comptia-network-n10-007-v-3-0-exam-objectives.pdf)

## Setup ðŸ’»
Open '/Users/[USERNAME]/demo/networkplus/labfiles/lab14-1/' in Wireshark.

## Lab Overview ðŸ”¬
For an IT Support Specialist, the practice of locating and analyzing network issues is similar to how X-rays and CAT scans offer visibility into the human body for prompt diagnoses. Network latency (aka slow wireless connection) is the delay in transmitting requests or data from the source to destination. This can be harder to troubleshoot than no connection at all because the device is properly connected to an SSID, has a valid IP address, and it runs well overall but YouTube loads painfully slow, the Play store times out. Long delays or excessive latency are undesirable since they degrade the user experience. When troubleshooting network latency, we utilize Wireshark in many ways to quickly and efficiently discover the source of poor performance. 

### Let's examine the different causes of network latency

#### A. High Latency
High latency refers to the time it takes for data to transit from one endpoint to another which has a big impact on network communications.
