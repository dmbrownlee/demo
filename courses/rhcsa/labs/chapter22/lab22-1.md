# lab22-1: Apache VirtualHost (w/SELinux)
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you repeat lab21-1 by configuring an Apache VirtualHost and test it from another machine.  However, this time you also have to configure SELinux (it was disabled for you in the previous lab).  You will know you can have completed the lab successfully when you can use Firefox on server1 to see the PHP information page at http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php.

## SETUP

Log into server2 as student and run:
```
cd /labfiles/chapter22 && ansible-playbook lab22-1.yml
```
This will install Apache with PHP support, create the virtual host's web content, and disable SELinux.

## STEPS

1.  Login to server1 as user, open Firefox, and confirm the URL http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php does not currently work.
1.  Login to server2 as root and configure a name-based VirtualHost with testweb.example.com as the virtual hostname and /var/www-testweb as the DocumentRoot
1.  Troubleshoot until you can view the PHP info page in Firefox at http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php (if you get stuck, there is a HINTS file in this directory).
