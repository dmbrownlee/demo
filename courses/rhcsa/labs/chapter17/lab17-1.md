# lab17-1: Change the default runlevel
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice changing the state you want the machine to
boot to by default.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

Use server2 for this lab.  Server2 starts with a "Minimal" server installation
of CentOS.

1.  Install the "Server With GUI" environment, and notice that it still does not boot into a graphical interface when rebooted.
1.  Configure server2 so that it boots to a graphical login
1.  Remove "rhgb" and "quiet" from the GRUB configuration so you can watch the system messages as it boots
