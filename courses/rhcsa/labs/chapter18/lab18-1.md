# lab18-1: GRUB troubleshooting
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

## SETUP

Log into server2 and run:

```
cd /labfiles/chapter18 && ansible-playbook lab18-1.yml
```

This playbook will break the machine.  Since the goal of this lab is to investgate the root cause and fix it, the output of the lab18-1.yml playbook above has been deliberately obscured.  Try to complete the steps below without first looking at what the playbook did.

## STEPS

1. Get server2 working again.  Here is the scenario:

   > The user used to have a veritically oriented monitor.  He was trying to change the monitor orientation back to horizontal but couldn't remember how he originally configured it.  He thought the problem was in the grub.cfg file and tried to edit it but, not being proficient in vim, he he the wrong keys and messed things up.  He tried to undo his accidental changes but must of missed something and now his machine won't boot.  He is now turning to you, the professional.  ;)
