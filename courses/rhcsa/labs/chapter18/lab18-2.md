# lab18-2: Troubleshoot the boot process
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

## SETUP

Log into server2 and run:

```
cd /labfiles/chapter18 && ansible-playbook lab18-2.yml
```

This playbook will break the machine.  Since the goal of this lab is to investgate the root cause and fix it, the output of the lab18-2.yml playbook above has been deliberately obscured.  Try to complete the steps below without first looking at what the playbook did.

## STEPS

1. Get server2 working again.
