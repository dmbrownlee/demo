# lab15-2: Stratis 

## Objective
Practice and understand more advanced storage types within linux. 

## Host Configuration

1. cd /demo/courses/rhcsa/VMs

2. vagrant destroy server1 

3. vagrant up server1 

4. vagrant down server1 

5. Add a drive to this machine
	
	a. Open virtual box and navigate to `settings`

	b. Next select `storage` 

	c. Towards the bottom you should see a "Drive" with a grenn `+` beside it, this is how we will add the drive 

	d. This should open a new window, once open selecte the `create` option at the top 
		i. I will generate a vdi with about 10gb of data 
		ii. Once it is generated and in the list of drives, highlight the drive and select `choose`

	e. once the disk is added to the virtual machine, we will want to ensure the machine sees this. Turn on the machine and run `lsblk`
		i. you should see two block devices `sda` and `sdb`


## Installation and Configuration

							Note

1. First we will need to install the packages for setup, which includ `stratis-cli` and `stratisd`


``` 
	sudo yum install stratis-cli stratisd -y
```

2. After this, we will need to ensure the daemon is running, 

```
	sudo systemctl enable --now stratisd && sudo systemctl status stratisd
```


3. Next we will want to generate a pool (group), which stores all availble storage devices for stratis. Keep in mind, these generate `xfs` file systems. 

									Note 
`ensure you add the drive we generated earlier, for me this is sda`

```
	sudo stratis pool create my-pool /dev/sda
```

4. Awesome, now that we have a drive(s) added to this pool, we should generate a file system. 

```
	sudo stratis fs create my-pool my-fs
```
	
5. for verification that the pools and lists are generated we can run 

```
	sudo stratis pool && sudo stratis fs 
```


## Mounting Stratis with systemd

In this section I will show you how to mount with systemd. Systemd is the future and is much easier to digest than /etc/fstab. While /etc/fstab is still a way of mounting devices, You will see people start transtioning to systemd mounting.

1. lets start with a directory to mount our filesystem on, I will call mine stratis1 

```
	cd && mkdir stratis1 && ls
```

2. Now we will need a template for systemd mounting, lets use vdo as that will be our next lab. Keep in mind, this vdo mount will come in handy down the road.  

```
	sudo apt install vdo -y 
```

									Note
`ensure the mount file is the same name as the mount point directory`

```
	sudo cp /usr/share/doc/vdo/examples/systemd/VDO.mount.example /etc/systemd/system/stratis1.mount
```

3.Great, now we will want to edit the stratis1.mount file, I prefer vim and encourage everyone to use vim, but I suppose you can use whatever text editor you are comfortable with. 

-------------

	[Unit]
	Description = Mount filesystem that lives on Stratis
	name = dataSTR.mount
	Requires = stratisd.service systemd-remount-fs.service
	After = multi-user.target
	Conflicts = umount.target

	[Mount]
	What = /stratis/stratpool/stratfs
	Where = /dataSTR
	Type = xfs
	Options = discard

	[Install]
	WantedBy = multi-user.target	

-------------

4. Great, stat should be all the file perameters we need, now we need to ensure that `my-fs` is mounted onto the `stratis1` directory on boot, with our handy dandy `systemctl` tool 

```
	sudo systemctl enable --now stratis1.mount
```

5. There are a few ways we can check this ranging from the `mount | grep stratis`, lets reboot and check if it mounts on boot. 

	a. we can also run `lsblk` to see if uuid of the device is mounted to stratis1, which in my case it is.
