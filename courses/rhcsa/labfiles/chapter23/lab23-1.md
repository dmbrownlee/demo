# lab23-1: Firewall configuration
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice configuring the firewall on server2 using firewall-cmd.  The firewall is already configured but you can make it better.

## SETUP

Log into server2 as student and run:

  ansible-playbook -K /labfiles/chapter23/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK

## STEPS

Note, the VMs have two network interfaces.  One of the network interfaces is on a private network that vagrant uses to manage the VMs from the host OS.  This network only needs to allow SSH connections.  The other network interface is what the VM uses to communicate with the Internet.  Identify which interface is which before beginning.

1.  Assign the private interface vagrant uses to the "trusted" zone
1.  Make sure the trusted interface above accepts inbound SSH connections
1.  Assign the other interface to the "internal" zone
1.  Make sure the internal interface also accepts inbound SSH
1.  Make "internal" the default zone
1.  Make all your changes permanent and verify after rebooting
