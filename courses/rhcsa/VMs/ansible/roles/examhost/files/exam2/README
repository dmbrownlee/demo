Complete the tasks below in any order you like (However, the order in which you
complete the tasks may make the exam esier or harder).

- Make sure SELinux is set to enforcing.

- Make sure the firewall is enabled.

- Configure sshd to listen to port 2022

- Create a 4GB logical volume named tftpboot in a new volume group,
  format it with XFS, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/lib/tftpboot when
  the system is booted.

- Install the syslinux package, the Apache server, and a TFTP server.

  (Hint: When troubleshooting a problem, it can be helpful to compare the
   configuration of a machine that works to that one that doesn't.)

  (Tip: After you have configured the repo for the BaseOS, run "dnf4dd update" and
  reinstall the package that provides the default repo config files to reenable
  the other default yum repositories).

- Copy the following files from /usr/share/syslinux to
  /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux:
  - pxelinux.0
  - ldlinux.c32
  - menu.c32
  - libutil.c32

- Download vmlinuz and initrd.img from
  http://mirror.centos.org/centos/8/BaseOS/x86_64/os/isolinux/ and move them to
  /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux/.

- Create a 2GB logical volume named data in any volume group with space,
  format it with ext4, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/data by UUID when
  the system is booted.

- Create users xavier, jed, and hastin.  Make xavier and jed members of a group
  named accounting and hastin a member of a group named auditors.  Set their
  passwords to "password" and force them to change their passwords on the next
  login.

  (Note: consider creating another user who is not in either group to verify
  access restrictions for "other")

- Ensure all current and future files under /var/data are readable and writable
  by members of accounting and readable by members of auditors.  Nobody outside
  these two groups should have access (other than root).  Also ensure members
  of accounting can delete only the files belonging to them.

- Ensure all newly created users (including xavier, jed, and hastin) see the
  following message on every login:
  "Welcome to FQDN!  Use of this private system is subject to
   corporate policy." (replace FQDN with the full name of the host)
