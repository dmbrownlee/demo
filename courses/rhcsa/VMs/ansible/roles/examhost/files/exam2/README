= Complete the tasks below in any order you like (However, the order in which
= you complete the tasks may make the exam esier or harder).
=
================================================================================

- Make sure SELinux is set to enforcing.

- Make sure the firewall is enabled at boot.

- Configure sshd to listen on port 2022 instead of 22

- Use the system performance tuner to configure the recommended performance
  settings.

================================================================================

= Storage Management Tasks
=
================================================================================

- Create two partitions on the second, unused hard drive.  The first partition
  should be 8GB and have type LVM (8e).  The second partition should consume
  the rest of the disk and you can leave it with the default type, linux (83).

- Create a volume group named "vg_data" using the first partition of the second
  drive as the physical volume.

- Create a 4GB logical volume named lv_tftpboot in the vg_data volume group,
  format it with XFS, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/lib/tftpboot when
  the system is booted.

- Create a 2GB logical volume named lv_share in the vg_data volume group,
  format it with ext4, and make sure it gets mounted on /var/shares by UUID when
  the system is booted.

- Create a Stratis pool named "pool1" on the second partition of the second
  drive and create a file system within the pool named "repo".

- Create a Stratis file system in pool1 with the name "repo" and ensure it is
  mounted by UUID to /var/webroot/repo when the system boots.

- Grow the lv_share logical volume to consume all available space in the
  vg_data volume group.

================================================================================
=
= User, Group and File System Management Tasks
=
================================================================================

- Create users yuki, lars, and sade.  Make yuki and lars members of a group
  named writers and sade a member of a group named editors.  Set their
  passwords to "password" and force them to change their passwords on the next
  login.

  (Note: consider creating another user who is not in either group writers nor
  group editors to verify access restrictions for "other")

- Ensure all current and future files under /var/shares/writers are readable,
  writable, and owned by the writers group and readable by members of editors.
  Nobody outside these two groups should have access (well, other than root who
  has access to everything).  Also ensure members of writers can delete only the
  files belonging to them even though they can edit each other's files.

- Ensure all newly created users (including yuki, lars, and sade) see the
  following message on every login:
  
  Welcome to <FQDN>!  Use of this private system is subject to corporate policy.
   
  (Note: Replace <FQDN> with the full name of the host)

- Login as yuki and create 100 text files in /var/shares/writers with the names
  page00.txt through page99.txt (these can be empty files, they just need to
  exist)
  
================================================================================
=
= Container Tasks
=
================================================================================

- Create a rootless nginx container that replies to requests received by the
  host on port 8080, serves content from /var/webroot on the host, and start
  when the system is booted.

================================================================================
=
= Create a software repository
=
================================================================================

- Copy the contents of the BaseOS directory on the Rocky 9 DVD media into
  /var/webroot/repo directory and use the createrepo command to create the 
  necessary files to use it as a software reposity.  Verify that it works.

  (Note: you can insert the ISO file in the ~/Downloads directory into the
  virtual optical drive on the host through the VM settings or by clicking
  the CD icon at the bottom of exam2's window)

================================================================================
=
= Create a server for network installations (PXE)
=
================================================================================

- Install the syslinux package, the Apache server, and a TFTP server.

  (Hint: When you run into a problem, a common troubleshooting technique is to
  compare the configuration of a machine that works to that one that doesn't.)

- Ensure the web server and TFTP server are listening for incoming connections
  and are not blocked by the firewall.

- Copy the contents of /tftpboot to /var/lib/tftpboot/pxelinux

- Copy vmlinuz and initrd.img from the isolinux directory on the Rocky 9
  ISO media to /var/lib/tftpboot.

- Verify you can download files from exam2 to exam1 using tftp.
