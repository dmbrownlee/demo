=== LAB 24: Convert epoch timestamps to human readable timestamps
OBJECTIVE
In this lab, you will practice translating epoch time into human readable time.

SETUP
Before beginning the lab, follow these steps to prepare the hosts indicated
(these steps assume a cleanly installed host OS and VMs):

  Host OS:

  server1:

  server2:
    The grubby utility is used to update the grub boot menu.  When it is run,
    it logs to /var/log/grubby_prune_debug using epoch timestamps in square
    brackets. Check the size of /var/log/grubby_prune_debug to verify it exists
    and has data. If it doesn't, run as root:
        grubby --update-kernel=ALL --remove-args quiet

  labipa:

STEPS
1. Get the epoch timestamp from the last line and convert it to a human readable
   timestamp so you can see when grubby last completed a run.
