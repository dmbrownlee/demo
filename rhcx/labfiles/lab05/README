=== LAB 05: Using virtual consoles to work with multiple users

OBJECTIVE:

In this lab, you will practice working with different user accounts. Rather
than switching back and forth between two users using su (or worse, logging in
and out), it is more efficient to have each user logged in on a separate
terminal and switch terminals as needed using keyboard hotkeys.

STEPS:

  1. Make sure your virtual machines are started
  2. Open the console for server1 and login
  3. Use ctrl-alt-F2 to switch to virtual console 2 on the host OS
  4. This isn't what you want to switch back to the GUI on virtual console 1
  5. Use the "Send Key" menu at the top of the server1 console to send
     ctrl-alt-F2 to server1
  6. Login to the first text console (console 2) on server1
  7. Change to the second text console (console 3) on server1
  8. Login again and then use "sudo -i" to get a root shell
  9. Practice switching back an forth between the GUI on console 1, the shell
     on console 2, and the root shell on console 3
