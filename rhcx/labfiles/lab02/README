=== LAB 02: Using Essential Tools - Vim

OBJECTIVE:

In this lab, you will practice using vim to do the following:

  Replace text
  Exit without saving
  Saving the file with out exiting
  Exit and save the file
  Move to a specific line
  Delete entire line
  Delete the character a time
  Coping text 
  Pasting text


STEPS:

You can do this lab on the host or in any of the VMs.

  1. Create a file in vim named training.txt
  2. Add the following lines to the file:

      Food
      Water
      Exercise
      Work
      Movies
      Eat
      Sleep
      Study

  3. Replace the word "Work" with "Shower"
  4. Delete the word "Study"

For additional practice, run "vimtutor" on the command line instead of vim.
That will open a practice doc in vim that you can read and edit simultaneously.
It will take around 30 minutes to complete.
