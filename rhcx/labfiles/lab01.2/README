=== LAB 01.2: Installing CentOS

OBJECTIVE:

Get familiar with the CentOS installer as well as learn just enough about KVM
virtual machines to give you a platform to test on.  In this lab, you will
practice installing your own centos machine.  You will be using the Virtual
Machine Manager app to configure a new virtual machine.

SETUP:

Before beginning the lab, you may want to skim Chapter 10 of the study guide
and/or watch the videos in Chapter 11 of the video series on Safari Online for
additional background on virtual machines.

STEPS:

On the host machine:

  1. Open Virtual Machine Manager (Applications > System Tools > Virtual
     Machine Manager)
  2. Create a new virtual machine and ensure it has a CD-ROM drive
     a. File > New Virtual Machine
     b. Select "Local install media (ISO image or CDROM)" and click "Forward"
     c. Select "Use ISO image" and click "Browse..."
     d. Click "Browse Local"
     e. Navigate to the Downloads directory,
        select CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1708.iso, and click "Open"
     f. Click "Forward". If prompted with a message about fixing permissions,
        click "Yes"
     g. Set Memory to 1024 and CPUs to 1 and click "Forward"
     h. Specify at least 9.0 GB for storage and click "Forward"
     i. Choose a name for the virtual machine and click "Finish"

The virtual machine will launch and boot from the virtual CDROM drive.  The
window size is fine for the text display but may be too small for the GUI.  To
fix this, wait until the GUI has started and then choose View > Resize to VM
from the Virtual Machine Manager menus.  From there, you can install as you
would on a real machine.  When the installation is complete and you click
"Reboot", the ISO image will be ejected from the virtual CDROM drive
automatically.

When you are ready to remove the virtual machine, turn it off and then right
click on the virtual machine in Virtual Machine Manager's list of machines.
Choose "Delete" from the menu, keep "Delete associated storage files" selected,
and click "Delete".
