# lab19-1: Bash Shell Scripting
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice creating a shell script that takes arguments and generates a DNS zone file.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

- Create a shell script that meets these criteria:
  - The script runs like any other command (so long as it is in the path).
  - The script takes a single argument, a string of an IPv4 netblock (e.g.  192.168.1.0).
  - The script creates a DNS zone file (which is just text) on STDOUT beginning with this header:
  ```
  $ORIGIN example.com.
  @                      3600 SOA   ns1.example.com. (
                                zone-admin.example.com.    ; address of responsible party
                                <DATE>                     ; serial number
                                3600                       ; refresh period
                                600                        ; retry period
                                604800                     ; expire time
                                1800                     ) ; minimum ttl
                        86400 NS    ns1.example.com.
                        86400 NS    ns2.example.com.
                        3600 MX    10 mail.example.com.
  ```
  - Replace ```<DATE>``` in the header above with the date in YYYYmmddHHMM format.
  - After the above header, include lines that look like this:
  ```
  dhcp<HOST>    60 A    <PREFIX>.<HOST>
  ```
  - Each line above should replace ```<PREFIX>``` with the first three octets of the network address passed as the first argument on the command line and ```<HOST>``` with the numbers 100 through 199.

> NOTE: Don't get too fancy.  The goal is to demonstrate you can make a script that loops, not the world's best shell script ever.
