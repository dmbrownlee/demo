# lab20-1: Lock down sshd
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will tighten security on sshd

## SETUP

For this lab, login to server2 but make the changes remotely on server1. Do not log into server1 directly via the Virtual Machine Manager app.  Imagine server1 is on the other side of town and, if you accidentally lock yourself out, you will need to spend 90 minutes in traffic to visit the server1's physical location to fix it.

## STEPS

1.  On server2, as user "student", generate an ssh keypair if you don't already have one and do what's necessary to allow student to ssh from server2 to server1 without a password.
1.  After verifying passwordless logins work, disable password logins for all users.
1.  Configure the sshd so that is only accepts incoming ssh connections from user "student".
1.  Configure sshd to run on port 2022
1.  Verify SELinux is in "Enforcing" mode and enable it if it isn't
