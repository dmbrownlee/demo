## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice scheduling a command to run at a specified
interval using cron.  The command could be anything you could run in a terminal
including a shell script.  In this lab, we use the "logger" command to generate
system log messages so we can verify the command is getting executed as
intended.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

1.  On the host machine or in any VM, add a cronjob to run the following
    command every minute (you might find using the crontab.template file in
    the same directory as this README is a good starting point):

    logger "MY_CRON_TEST"

2.  Use this command and wait a few minutes to verify your cronjob is running
    as planned:

    sudo tail -f /var/log/messages | grep MY_CRON_TEST

3.  Imagine your logger command is actually a script to do "end of month"
    processing of sales data.  Change the cronjob so it "runs the monthly
    report (logs a message)" after each month.  Unless you are on the last day
    of the month and can wait until tomorrow, you won't be able to verify this
    (unless you change the system time).  Either way, make sure you don't leave
    the cronjob you created in step one running.

EXTRA CREDIT: How would you schedule a job to run the first and third Friday
              of the month?
