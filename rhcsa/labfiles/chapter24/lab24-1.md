# lab24-1: Firewalls and NFS RPCs
## OBJECTIVE

Our study guide mentions firewalls can break the ```showmount``` command.  In this lab, you will learn what the fix for that looks like.

## SETUP
Log into server2 as student and run:

ansible-playbook -K /labfiles/chapter24/setup-server2.yml

This will configure the firewall but you will need to setup the rest.

## STEPS

### On server2
1.  Ensure the NFS server is installed and running
1.  Export ```/home``` to all hosts on the 192.168.4.0/24 network with these options:
  ```rw,root_squash```
1.  Use ```showmount -e server2.example.com``` to verify you are exporting the directory
1.  Create a user named ```nfsuser``` for testing

### On server1
1.  Create a ```/export/home``` directory and configure the same SELinux fcontext type on /export/home as is on /home
1.  Configure server1 to automount subdirectories of server2:/home under ```/export/home```
1.  Create a user named ```nfsuser``` on server1 with the same UID and GID but specify the home directory is ```/export/home/nfsuser``` and choose not to create it
1.  Observer the current contents of ```/export/home``` (should be empty)
1.  Set a password for ```nfsuser``` and login (you should see ```/export/home/nfsuser```
1.  Run ```mount -t nfs```

### Back on server2
1.  View the firewall rules to see if you can figure out why showmount works when the book suggests it should be broken
1.  If you think if found the answer, change the firewall rules temporarily to test your hypothesis
