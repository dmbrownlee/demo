# lab15-1: Practice LVM
## OBJECTIVE

Practice using LVM and configuring logical volumes mounted on boot using a
second disk.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

1.  Login to server2 as student
1.  Create a new volume group using the second disk as the physical volume
  > If you need to remove partitions you made for the previous chapter's lab, don't forget to remove them from ```/etc/fstab``` or you're going to have a bad day.
1.  Create a logical volume that uses the entire volume group, format it with ext4, and make sure it is mounted at boot by UUID (reboot to test this)
1.  Shrink the logical volume to half its current size

### BONUS
The book describes how to mount a VDO file system using /etc/fstab but the lab in the book only configures a mount unit via systemd.  Do you need both?  Will either work?
