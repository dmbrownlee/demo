# lab21-1: Apache VirtualHost
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will prove you can configure an Apache VirtualHost and test it from another machine.  You will know you can have completed the lab successfully when you can use Firefox on server1 to see the PHP information page at http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php.

## SETUP

Log into server2 as student and run:

  ansible-playbook -K /labfiles/chapter21/setup-server2

This will install Apache with PHP support, create the virtual host's web content, and disable SELinux.

## STEPS

1.  Login to server1 as student, open Firefox, and confirm the URL http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php does not currently work.
1.  Login to server2 and configure a name-based VirtualHost with testweb.example.com as the virtual hostname and use /var/www-testweb as the DocumentRoot
1.  Troubleshoot until you can view the PHP info page in Firefox at http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php (if you get stuck, there is a HINTS file in this directory).
