# lab18-1: GRUB troubleshooting
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

## SETUP

Log into server2 and run:

```ansible-playbook -K /labfiles/chapter18/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK```

This will break the machine.  As the name implies, don't look at ```setup-server2-DONT_LOOK``` as that will give away how the machine was broken and figuring that out is the point of the exercise

## STEPS

1. Get server2 working again.  Here is the scenario:

   > The user used to have a veritically oriented monitor.  He was trying to change the monitor orientation back to horizontal but couldn't remember how he originally configured it.  He thought the problem was in the grub.cfg file and tried to edit it but, not being proficient in vim, he he the wrong keys and messed things up.  He tried to undo his accidental changes but must of missed something and now his machine won't boot.  He is now turning to you, the professional.  ;)
