=== LAB 24.2: Mount NFS shares using Kerberos Security

OBJECTIVE

Get hands on practice mounting NFS exports using Kerberos security.  Page 520
of the study guide (RHCSA 7) describes how to mount NFS exports using Kerberos
security but does not describe the steps needed to create the Kerberos keytabs
needed to test this since it is outside of the scope of the RHCSA.  The setup of
this lab will walk you through that so you can using Kerberos security with NFS.

SETUP

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!  THIS LAB ONLY WORKS ON CentOS 7.x LAB MACHINES  !!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
If you only have CentOS 8 VMs, skip this lab.

Ensure all VMs are running (clean VMs are assumed).

On server1 and server2:
  1. Run (as root) "/labfiles/lab23.2/setup.sh"

On labipa:
  2. Run (as root) "/labfiles/lab23.2/setup.sh" (this has to be run after running
     this script on the other two VMs first)

STEPS

1.  Login to either server1 or server2 and use "showmount -e labipa.example.com"
    to confirm labipa.example.com is exporting /home/ldap
2.  On both server1 and server2, ensure the requirements for Kerberos as listed
    on p.520 are met:
    a.  Ensure the host keytab contains the NFS principal with (password for
        kinit is "password"):
        kinit admin &&
        ipa-getkeytab -p nfs/$(hostname --fqdn) -k /etc/krb5.keytab
        # hint: If you get "Failed to add key to the keytab", ask yourself why.
    b.  Enable and start the nfs-secure service
3.  Test mount labipa:/home/ldap to /mnt and verify it is using krb5p as the
    security method
4.  Use the NFS4 root mount option to mount all of labipa's exports under
    /mnt without specifying a security level and then use "mount -t nfs4" to
    observe the results before and after changing into the /mnt/home/ldap
    directory (note also the sec option on each mount)
5.  On server2, create a /home/ldap directory and add a line to /etc/fstab to
    mount the /home/ldap directory on labipa using krb5p security (make sure to
    reboot to verify it works)
