# lab10-1: Managing Processes
## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice finding poorly behaving processes and shut them
down.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS 

Complete these steps on server1.

1. Open a terminal and run:
  ```
  while true; do echo "Are we there yet?"; sleep 2; done
  ```

  The previous command will echo a message to the screen every two seconds.

1. Stop the previous command without closing the terminal
1. Now run this in your terminal:
  ```
  (while true; do ls -LR / > /dev/null 2>&1 ; done) &
  ```

  You should get a prompt back right away.

1. Figure out which process is using most of your CPU and terminate the process.
1. Read the man page for "ps" to find out how to change the output so that only
   this information is displayed about every process:
   - The user running the process
   - The process ID
   - The percent of CPU the process is using
   - The percent of memory the process is using
   - The command line used to start the process,pid

1. How would you sort the output of ps by total CPU time the process has used?
1. What do you think this command is showing you:
  ```
  echo $$
  ```
1. Run the ```top``` command and sort the displayed tasks by memory usage.
