## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you repeat lab21 by configuring an Apache VirtualHost and test
it from another machine.  However, this time you also have to configure SELinux
(it was disabled for you in the previous lab).  You will know you can have
completed the lab successfully when you can use Firefox on server1 to see the
PHP information page at http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php.

## SETUP

Log into server2 as root and run:

  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab21/setup-server2

This will install Apache with PHP support, create the virtual host's
web content, and disable SELinux.

## STEPS

1.  Login to server1 as user, open Firefox, and confirm the URL
    http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php does not currently work.
2.  Login to server2 as root and configure a name-based VirtualHost with
    testweb.example.com as the virtual hostname and /var/www-testweb as
    the DocumentRoot
3.  Troubleshoot until you can view the PHP info page in Firefox at
    http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php (if you get stuck, there is a
    HINTS file in this directory).
