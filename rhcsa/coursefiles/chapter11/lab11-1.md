## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice working with systemd.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

Do these steps on server2.

1.  Check the status of the "tftp" service (install the tftp and tftp-server
    packages if they are not already installed)
2.  Configure the tftp server to start at boot and start it now (can you do
    this with a single command?)
3.  Check the status of the tftp server again and Use the tftp client to verify
    not only is it running but you can also connect to the tftp-server (don't
    assume a service is functional just because systemd says it is running; it
    could be blocked by a firewall or otherwise not operating the way you
    expect)
4.  Verify your changes survive a reboot
5.  List the dependencies of the tftp service
6.  Compare the tftp server's dependencies with that of sshd; Explore the
    differences by looking at the systemd system files; How do the dependency
    differences relate to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file on the ssh client?
7.  Install the "Server with GUI" package environement on server2 and configure
    server2 to boot to a graphical interface
8.  Reboot to verify your work (after verifying your work, undo step 7)
